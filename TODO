1. refactor modeling code/folder
    - create formal contract/object for each model
    - should provide its own custom feature parse
    - automate feature parse and model build in same step
    - write out model and prediction accuracy as joblib file and text file 

2. refactor featurize.py

    - featurizing functions should be associated with each model instead

3. refactor cortex_poll

    - cleaner realtime processing debug printing/monitoring
    - send to keyboard needs contract
