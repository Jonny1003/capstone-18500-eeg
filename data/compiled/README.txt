This folder contains eeg recordings of the given folder's action. 

The folders correspond to each action we are recording through EEG. The folder 
structure in here should be near identical to the raw folder. 

Each csv file is a SEPARATE recording. The name of the csv file is 
the action type followed by the first time stamp of the recording.
